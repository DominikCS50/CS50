# CS50
My work from CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science Course by Harvard

5.03/ finance is a CRUD app, the most recent completed, most sophisticated task. 

6.11/ dna is a Python app that let you check and compare db of dna.

My CS50 journey has started with working on C, the basics of programming.
Than it has switched to the Python language, currently I'm working on SQL.
